# ATLAS
Algorithmic Trading via Language Analysis of Sentiment

bert.py contains our fine-tuned BERT model implementation using pytroch, including related dataset, collate, and performance calculation functions.
atlas.ipynb is used to run our exepriments, first building our daily and weekly datasets and then using our model implementation in bert.py to train and evluate our model. 
We also attempted to build a dataset of summarized articles and then train a fine-tuned BERT model on it in articles.ipynb, but becasue of poor performance we did not include this in our final report.
